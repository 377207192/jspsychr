# jsPsychR
R markdown template for jsPysch

## Install

```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("CrumpLab/jsPsychR")
```

## Usage

A new jsPsych template option should appear when creating an .rmd from template. Currently, knitting the .rmd should produce a working jsPsych example experiment. This is currently an experiment, and doesn't do much else.

## Examples

Head over to the examples repo to see some examples (work in progress). [https://github.com/CrumpLab/jsPsychRexamples](https://github.com/CrumpLab/jsPsychRexamples)
