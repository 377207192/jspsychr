This is an R markdown template and functions for writing and running jspsych experiments using R studio.

- [jspsych](https://www.jspsych.org) is javascript library for web-based behavioral experiments written by Josh De Leeuw.

- If you are interested in other approaches to build jspsych experiments, also check out Danielle Navarro's [xprmntr](https://github.com/djnavarro/xprmntr), and [jaysire](https://github.com/djnavarro/jaysire)

- jspsychr developed as a forked offshoot of the original xprmntr package
